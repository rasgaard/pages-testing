Something crazy happened this week: I finally embraced that I don't know what I'm doing and allowed myself to play around with React, Next.js and a little bit of Convex. It feels silly to "allow myself" to do so but it's a pattern that I recognize all too well. You are proficient in one domain and it sucks to feel like a beginner in another one. 

In my case this has lead to misconceptions about technologies that could have been avoided had I just spent 30 minutes to actually play around with it. For example, I somehow had the idea that React apps had to be ran on a server. That you could not host them as static sites. 

My motivation for doing this at all has been a fascination with building full stack applications. Having the ability to go from an idea to a fully fledged web app seems so empowering in a way. 

Watching Web Dev Cody after playing reading through a few Getting Started guides and getting my hands dirty with some intro to tutorials was great. The fundamentals were covered in the tutorials so I had some of the necessary language and context to understand the long-form build videos that he sometimes makes. 

I'm looking forward to exploring web development even more. I feel like there's a huge potential for simple applications that lack together AI functionality and tailor-made UIs. Let's see if anything comes of it.

I'm increasingly worried about the future of the open internet. Governments imposing surveillance on the basis of "protecting children" from "harmful content" is a scary slippery slope. 

I suspect that privacy services will skyrocket. VPNs, E2E encryption, etc. Maybe even to the point where alternative internet services like the onion network will become more mainstream. It's hard to say what will pass and what the consequences will be. 

Here is a few recent resources that I have enjoyed which cover the subject.
